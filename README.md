# Nigeria Covid-19 Data Analysis
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, and it has affected major parts of the world. Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first case on 27th February 2020.

Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 200 million citizens. COVID-19 has affected several country activities as the country steadily progressed from its first case to shutting down major airports, state-wide lockdown, curfews, and reviving its economy.

In this project, you will employ data science & analytics skills to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights.


## Project Steps
 First, web scraped data from the Nigeria Covid-19 official website (https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/) containing data on states in Nigeria and their confirmed,discharged,admitted and death cases, also pulled data from John Hopkins Data Repository on Global Cases for Nigeria exclusively and some external data files that elaborates the effects of Covid-19 in Nigeria.(covid_external.csv, Budget data.csv, RealGDP.csv).
 
Second, The extracted data was thoroughly cleaned and set in better formats for proper data analysis and visualization.
## Project Insights
* #### Confirmed Cases : 
    Confirmed cases are counts of individuals whose coronavirus infections were confirmed by a laboratory test and reported by a federal, state, territorial or local government agency.

    

* #### Discharged Cases :
    Discharged Cases are counts of individuals who after series of medications were discharged by a laboratory or hospital to go back home after not exhibiting any more Covid-19 symptoms.

    

* #### Death Cases :
    Death Cases are confirmed deaths of individuals who have died and meet the definition for a confirmed Covid-19 case.

   

* #### Daily Infection Rate : 
    An infection rate is the probability or risk of an infection in a population.
    
    

* #### Pre Covid-19 GDP value and Covid-19 GDP Value:
    This is the Gross Domestic Product and their quarter values ranging from Q1-Q4.
    
## Stand-Outs
All the data analysis were presented in visual graphs for easy interpretation and all avaliable in the analysis notebook. 
## Future Work
Looking forward to working with more data related with the various States and their GDP values and outside this data analysis, working with more complex datasets and help interpreting such data into visual graphs.
